# onepage-portfolio

A responsive onepager to showcase my professional portfolio, designed following a mobile-first approach. It is built with pure HTML, CSS and some snippets of Javascript to toggle the hamburger menu on mobile screens. The CSS code uses native variables for repetitive values. A postprocessor was used to improve browser support.
