# Portfolio Website

A responsive onepager to showcase my professional portfolio, designed following a mobile-first approach. It is built with pure HTML, CSS and some snippets of Javascript to toggle the hamburger menu on mobile screens and for the functionallity of Read more / Read less buttons. The CSS code uses native variables for repetitive values. A postprocessor was used to improve browser support.
